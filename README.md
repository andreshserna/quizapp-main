# Quizapp

Project for React Training.\
This is a simple app for fetching data from an API (https://the-trivia-api.com) and render it on the screen.

-This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

-I also used ChatGpt to improve some parts of the code like the scss files and others.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
